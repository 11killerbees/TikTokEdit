00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,920
 All told, printing the pieces for this quad used about 3 kilograms of filament.

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,720
 By far though, the largest print was this center section.

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,440
 It used almost an entire roll of filament and took two days, even though I was printing

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,440
 much faster than normal using clipper.

5
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,960
 So two days of printing, what kind of clothes this was?

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,920
 Is it running out of film?

7
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,440
 This is a brand new spool right before I started.

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,000
 Oh my god, that's heavy.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 I got most of the support material out which is good, but then I realized that there were

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 some very unfortunate layers shifts that went on towards the end of the print.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,720
 They asked you how you were able to say that you're fine when you're not really.

12
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,200
 I guess this is what I'd get for switching to clipper.

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,860
 So since these layers shifts cause this to protrude at the end,
